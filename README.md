# 2022-Wordle-Helper
A program that can be used to help solve wordle

The help on this one is less than ideal (sorry about that).  The program you want to run is called 06_infinite_wordle which allows users to solve more than one wordle at a time.  I made this to experiment with culling down a list of possible words based on the letters that exist in specific positions / don't exist in the word at all.
